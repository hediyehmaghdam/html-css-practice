    <div class="selected-part"id="toner">what is toner?!</div>
    <img class="toner"src="new-folder/produce/toner.jpg" alt="toner">
    <p class="tonerp">
        A face wash toner is a skincare product that combines the properties of a facial cleanser and a toner.
         It is typically used as a step in the skincare routine to cleanse the skin and balance its pH after cleansing.
     Face wash toners are formulated with ingredients that help to remove dirt, oil, and makeup residue from the skin, while also toning and refreshing the skin.
     They often contain gentle cleansers, such as surfactants or plant-based extracts, that effectively cleanse the skin without stripping its natural oils. 
     Additionally, face wash toners may contain soothing and hydrating ingredients like aloe vera, chamomile, or witch hazel to help calm and moisturize the skin.
     The primary purpose of a face wash toner is to remove any remaining impurities from the skin after cleansing, unclog pores,
     and prepare the skin for the application of other skincare products, such as serums, moisturizers, or treatments. It can also help to balance the pH of the skin,
     as some cleansers can disrupt the skin's natural pH balance.
     Face wash toners are typically applied to the skin using a cotton pad or by gently patting it onto the skin with clean hands. 
     They can be used in the morning and evening as part of a daily skincare routine, depending on individual preferences and skin type.
     Using a face wash toner can be beneficial for various skin types, including oily, combination, and acne-prone skin, as it can help control excess oil,
     minimize the appearance of pores, and provide a refreshing sensation. However, it's important to choose a face wash toner 
     that is suitable for your skin type and concerns, and to patch test it before incorporating it
     into your regular skincare routine. Consulting with a dermatologist or skincare professional can also provide personalized recommendations for your specific skincare needs.

    <p class="bodyscrubp">
        Body scrub, also known as body exfoliator or body polish, is a cosmetic product used for exfoliating the skin on the body. 
        It typically consists of granular particles, such as sugar, salt, coffee grounds, or fruit seeds, mixed with a carrier oil or a creamy base. 
        Body scrubs are designed to be applied to damp skin and gently massaged in circular motions to remove dead skin cells, unclog pores, and improve the overall texture and appearance of the skin.
     Body scrubs are commonly used in skincare routines to promote skin renewal, increase circulation, and leave the skin feeling smooth and refreshed.
      They can be used on various parts of the body, including the arms, legs, back, and torso. After exfoliating with a body scrub, 
      it is important to rinse off the product thoroughly and follow up with a moisturizer or body lotion to replenish the skin's moisture barrier.
     Body scrubs come in a variety of formulations and fragrances, ranging from commercially available products to homemade DIY recipes. 
     It's important to choose a body scrub that is suitable for your skin type and avoid using it on broken or irritated skin. If you have any concerns about using a body scrub,
      it's best to consult with a dermatologist or skincare professional.

    <div class="selected-part"id="lip">what is lipstick?!</div>
    <img class="lip"src="new-folder/produce/lip.jpg" alt="lipstick">
    <p class="lipp">
        Lipstick is a cosmetic product that is typically used to add color, texture, and definition to the lips. It is one of the most popular and commonly used makeup products, loved for its ability to enhance the natural beauty of the lips and complete a makeup look.
     Lipstick is typically composed of a mixture of pigments, oils, waxes, and emollients that are blended together to create a smooth and creamy texture. 
     The pigments provide the color, while the oils, waxes, and emollients help to create a consistent and spreadable formula that glides easily on the lips.
     Lipstick comes in a wide variety of colors, ranging from natural nude tones to vibrant shades of red, pink, plum, and more. 
     It is available in various finishes, such as matte, satin, glossy, and metallic, offering different levels of shine and texture to suit different preferences.
     To apply lipstick, it is typically swiped directly onto the lips from the tube or applied with a lip brush for more precise application. 
     Lipstick can be used to define the shape of the lips, add color to the lips, and enhance the overall appearance of the mouth. 
     It can be worn alone for a subtle look or layered with other lip products, such as lip liners or lip gloss, for added dimension and customization.
     In addition to providing cosmetic benefits, many lipsticks also contain moisturizing ingredients, such as oils or butters, that can help keep the lips hydrated and prevent them from becoming dry or chapped.
     Lipstick has a long history, with evidence of its use dating back to ancient civilizations. 
     Today, it remains a popular and versatile makeup product that is used by people of all genders and ages to express their personal style, enhance their features, and add a touch of glamour to their look.

    <p class="creamp">
        Body cream, also known as body lotion, is a type of skincare product that is used to moisturize and nourish the skin on the body. 
     It is typically a thick, creamy or lotion-like substance that is applied topically to the skin to help hydrate and replenish the skin's natural moisture barrier.
     Body creams are formulated with a variety of ingredients, such as water, oils, butters, and emulsifiers, that work together to provide hydration, nourishment, and protection to the skin. 
     Some body creams may also contain additional ingredients, such as vitamins, antioxidants, and botanical extracts, that offer additional skincare benefits.
     Body cream is used to keep the skin soft, smooth, and supple, and it can be applied to various parts of the body, including the arms, legs, torso, and back. 
     It is typically used after bathing or showering, when the skin is clean and damp, to help lock in moisture and prevent dryness. 
     Regular use of body cream can help improve the skin's texture, tone, and overall health, and it is a common skincare product used in daily skincare routines.

    <div class="selected-part"id="water">what is hydro boost?!</div>
    <img class="water"src="new-folder/produce/water.jfif" alt="hydroboost">
    <p class="waterp">
        Hydro Boost is a skincare line created by Neutrogena that focuses on providing hydration to the skin. It is known for its use of hyaluronic acid, a powerful humectant that can hold up to 1,000 times its weight in water, to deliver intense hydration and help replenish the skin's moisture levels.
     Neutrogena Hydro Boost products are designed to provide hydration to different parts of the body, including the face, body, and eyes. 
     The Hydro Boost line includes a range of products, such as facial moisturizers, body lotions, sunscreen, cleansers, and eye creams, all formulated with hyaluronic acid to help boost and retain the skin's moisture.
     Hydro Boost products are typically lightweight and non-greasy, making them suitable for various skin types, including dry, normal, and combination skin. 
     They are often oil-free and non-comedogenic, which means they are less likely to clog pores or cause breakouts, making them suitable for acne-prone skin as well.
     The use of hyaluronic acid in Hydro Boost products helps to hydrate and plump the skin, improving its texture, elasticity, and overall appearance. 
     Regular use of Hydro Boost products can help to alleviate dryness, smooth out fine lines and wrinkles, and promote a healthier, more youthful-looking complexion. 
     However, as with any skincare product, it's important to patch test and follow the manufacturer's instructions for best results.
